By changing one of these, we can change the others. When we’re upset, we often fall into patterns of negative thinking and responding that can make us feel worse. If we don’t challenge these negative thoughts and behaviours, they can become a cycle. For example, if you feel depressed, you may withdraw from your friends. You may think you’re no good or that you don’t deserve their friendship. This can make you feel more depressed, which makes you withdraw even further. In CBT, your therapist will help you notice and change how you think and behave so you can break this cycle and feel better. CBT usually takes place over a set number of sessions, often 6 to 20 weekly or fortnightly sessions. This might be delivered one-to-one or in a group with a therapist, via a self-help book or through an online CBT programme. CBT is different to other talking therapies in several ways.

This might include recent problems, reflections on the previous session or planning for future events you might find difficult. Your therapist might give you exercises to do to explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviour. These could be worksheets, role plays or discussions. Based on what you’ve talked about, your therapist might suggest some more tasks to try. For example, if you’ve talked about feeling worried about letting your friends down, you might try saying ‘no’ to some small requests from them and seeing how that feels. Confronting your fears can be difficult, and your therapist won’t ask you to do things you don’t want to do. They should always work at your pace and check how you feel about your progress.

It’s never too late to give up, and you may find that quitting reduces your levels of stress, anxiety and depression. When a person smokes, nicotine reaches the brain within about ten seconds. At first, nicotine improves mood and concentration, decreases anger and stress, relaxes muscles and reduces appetite. Regular doses of nicotine lead to changes in the brain, which then lead to nicotine withdrawal symptoms when the supply of nicotine decreases. Smoking temporarily reduces these withdrawal symptoms and can therefore reinforce the habit. This cycle is how most smokers become nicotine dependent. Some people smoke as ‘self-medication’ to ease feelings of . However, research has shown that smoking actually increases anxiety and tension. Nicotine creates an immediate sense of relaxation, so people smoke in the belief it reduces stress and anxiety. This feeling is temporary and soon gives way to withdrawal symptoms and increased cravings. Smoking reduces withdrawal symptoms but doesn’t reduce anxiety or deal with the reasons someone may feel that way. . Most people start to smoke before showing signs of depression, so it’s unclear whether smoking leads to depression or depression encourages people to start smoking. It’s most likely that there is a complex relationship between the two. Nicotine stimulates the release of the chemical dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in triggering positive feelings. It is often found to be low in people with depression, who may then use cigarettes to temporarily increase their dopamine supply. However, smoking encourages the brain to switch off its mechanism for making dopamine, so in the long term, the supply decreases, which in turn prompts people to smoke more. People with depression can have particular difficulty when they try to stop smoking and have more severe withdrawal symptoms. Remember, there’s lots of support available if you decide to quit.

A recent study has shown smoking may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. However, further research is needed to fully understand how the two are linked. Stopping smoking suddenly through willpower alone is the least effective way to quit. If you plan, have support and choose the right time to try, you’re more likely to be successful.

Write down what you will gain by not smoking, such as better , fresher breath, improved concentration and more money to spend on other things. Stopping smoking can be easier with the support of family and friends. If you live with people who smoke, or have friends who smoke, suggest to them that you give up together. If other household members smoke, encourage them not to smoke around you or leave their cigarettes, ashtrays or lighters where you will see them. If you use smoking to cope with stress, you’ll need to find other ways to deal with it. Some things people find helpful are meditation and breathing exercises, regular , cutting down on , eating a well-balanced , acupuncture and hypnosis.

Many different situations or life events can cause stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new or unexpected that threatens our sense of self or when we feel we have little control over a situation. We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life events, personality and social and economic circumstances. When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system. This helps us respond quickly to dangerous situations. Sometimes, this stress response can be helpful. It can help us push through fear or pain so we can run a marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our stress hormones usually return to normal quickly once the stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting effects. However, too much stress can cause adverse effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect our physical and mental health. Even positive life changes, such as moving to a bigger house, gaining a job promotion or going on holiday, can be sources of stress. If you feel stressed in these situations, you may struggle to understand why or be unwilling to share your feelings with others. These feelings can sometimes produce physical symptoms, making you feel even worse. If the stress is long-lasting, you may notice your sleep and memory are affected, your eating habits change, or you feel less inclined to exercise. Some research has also linked long-term stress to gastrointestinal conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or stomach ulcers and conditions like cardiovascular disease. All of us can probably recognise some of the feelings described above. Some people seem to be more affected by stress than others.

Talking therapy can help with: It doesn’t have to be a last resort or something you turn to in a crisis. If you think you could do with talking to someone in a safe space who won’t judge you, then it’s ok to try it. There are many different approaches when it comes to therapy. Therapists may train in one approach or use a number of different methods. Some use specialist techniques – for example, an art therapist would use art to help you explore your feelings. Others offer specialist treatment for specific issues such as addictions or eating disorders. It can be easy to be overwhelmed by the number of different types of talking therapy out there.

CBT was amazing – it was so simple. My diagnosis is bipolar disorder and I had very low self-esteem and lack of confidence in my future. I had about 15 sessions over a year. The psychologist showed me how to notice what I was thinking and then how I felt afterwards, and to realise you can choose your own thoughts. I thought they were just random thoughts there to make my life a misery. But I learnt that at any time I could stop and say: ‘Why am I thinking that?’ I had a CBT therapist but I think she probably used lots of different things – in fact it didn’t feel like she was ‘using’ anything – it felt like a natural process rather than anything very medical or clinical. DBT is an adapted form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that can intensely help people who experience emotions. It teaches you how to live in the moment, cope with stress, regulate your emotions and improve your relationships. Psychodynamic therapy explores how your childhood experiences and unconscious mind influence your current thoughts, feelings, relationships and behaviour. Your therapist may use techniques such as: I was quite severely depressed as a teenager. I tried various antidepressants and some CBT-based stuff, but nothing was helping. Finally, my GP suggested that I try psychotherapy at my local mental health unit. At first I was sceptical. I couldn’t see how sitting in a room with a stranger was going to help. I was quite a nightmare, trying to prove to my therapist and myself that the therapy would fail. But with psychodynamic therapy, the therapist is prepared to sit and wait out that part with you. She started helping me link the way I was thinking, feeling and behaving to what might have gone on when I was younger and that really made sense. Humanistic therapy lets you explore your whole self rather than just specific problems. It aims to help you grow, live your life to the full and be true to yourself. Your therapist will offer you empathy, warmth and genuineness to help you make these changes.

I was referred to a unit that deals with people who turn to alcohol because of psychological problems. I was in a state of constant panic and had been drinking to keep those feelings at bay.

In group therapy you don’t just talk about yourself, you’re listening to other people – that takes the burden off your problems. You realise you’re not the only one. During a session, you might talk generally about how you’re feeling, or you might go through specific exercises, depending on your therapist’s approach. What you talk about could include your childhood, your relationships, past and present life events, or stressful situations. Your therapist will listen to you without judging you and help you explore your thoughts and feelings.

A good therapist concentrates on what is important in your life, what you want to achieve, and what steps you could take to get there. They shouldn't tell you what to do. Your therapist may be highly trained and very experienced, but you are the expert. Remember, therapy is a two-way process. If you have any questions, ask them. A good therapist will help you deal with your worries and work out how you will manage when therapy comes to an end. It can take time to build a relationship with your therapist and start to open up.

Our friends can keep us grounded, help us get things in perspective, and help us manage life's problems. “The best thing my friend did for me was that they just accepted me as I was.” If we’re experiencing a mental health problem, our instinct might be to hide away and avoid our friends. But friendships can play a key role in helping us live with or recover from a mental health problem and overcome the isolation that often comes with it. We can end up with the strongest relationships with the people who’ve supported us through hard times. “They kept coming to see me even though I didn’t seem to want them and they made me laugh.” Talking to friends about your mental health, and supporting a friend with a mental health problem, can be difficult to do. We have tips on how to start a conversation, offer support, and look after yourself. If you have a mental health problem, you may feel ashamed of ‘admitting’ to it. You may feel that you’re bothering or upsetting your friend, fear being labelled, or worry about how your friendship might change. You don’t have to tell your friends – and you certainly don’t have to tell everyone. Think about who you might feel comfortable talking to. It might help to write a list of the pros and cons of telling or not telling people about your problem. Tough as it can be, talking to close friends can be important for both of you. Even if you don’t talk about it again, having the issue out in the open means that you don’t have to worry about mentioning your mental health problem by accident or ‘explaining away’ medication or appointments. It may also clarify why you’re behaving in a particular way or don’t want to go out or talk to them much. “I wanted my friends to know so they...would cut me some slack if I behaved oddly.” You may want to practise your opening sentence or you may want to play it by ear. Choose a time and a place where you will both feel comfortable. Think about whether: You could phone or write to your friend if it’s easier than talking to them face to face. Understanding mental health problems can be difficult, despite how common they are. Be ready for your friend to be shocked or react badly. They may feel awkward and not know how to respond. This may be because they feel so worried about you, or perhaps your news has struck a chord with something in their own life. They may even suggest that you’re fine and just need to ‘pull yourself together'. Give them time to process what you’ve said. Most people don’t know very much about mental health issues so it may be a good idea to tell your friend about the problem itself but don’t overwhelm them. You could show them a book or website that’s helped you understand what you’re experiencing. If you don’t feel that turning to a friend is an option, there are other forms of informal help. and groups are often useful. By sharing your experiences, you can support other people and learn about how they cope with challenging situations. You could join a group centred around an activity: a book group, a chess club or an exercise class. If you don’t want to join a group, try going to places where there are lots of people such as a library, leisure centre or café. You don’t have to talk to anyone if you don’t want to, but just being around other people can help you feel more connected. Online communities can also be supportive, whether or not they are focused on mental health problems. Mind’s online community, , is where you can listen, share and be heard. If you’re a friend of someone with a mental health problem, you may be concerned about them. The most important thing is to show them that you’re still their friend and you care about them, whether that’s through your words, a hug, or another way that conveys how you feel. “My friend asked me questions, didn’t just assume things, she really wanted to know.” The most valuable support you can provide is just being there to talk and listen. Making time to call, text, visit or invite someone over can make a big difference. “My friend realised I had taken an overdose and rang for an ambulance... but has never judged me or criticised my action.” Mental health problems can be misunderstood. Simply acknowledging your friend’s problems, accepting them and treating them with compassion is important. Your friend isn’t looking for another mental health professional – they just want your support as a friend. They’re likely to want to keep things as normal as possible, even if you need to adapt some of the activities you used to do together (for example, because they feel anxious in big groups or their medication makes them tired in the evenings). “My friend phoned me, talked to me about normal stuff, sent me letters, took me out sometimes.” Remember that someone who insists they’re fine may be in a bad way. They may just need to talk, or they may need professional help. Men are often particularly reluctant to talk about emotional issues. The NHS offers advice for , which can be as simple as asking someone if they’re sure if they tell you they’re feeling fine. Practical help can be valuable too. Cleaning, shopping and basic household tasks can seem impossible to someone who is having a difficult time. Ask your friend what they need: it could be going to appointments with them, helping them manage their finances or finding information about therapies and services, for example. Some people reach the point where they feel they’ve become more of a carer instead of a friend. You may feel responsible for your friend and worry about what would happen if you weren’t around. It can be painful and embarrassing – on both sides – to admit that this is happening. But there are things you can do to look after yourself and rebalance the friendship. For example: “I gave my friend a lot of support and at times felt close to burning out. Now that my friend has recovered we are closer than before. However, I worry that I might not be able to cope with another episode.” Different types of peer support, what peer support can help with and how to find peer support.

We may drink to try and change our mood: to feel more relaxed, courageous or confident. However, the effect of alcohol is only temporary. As it wears off, we often feel worse because of how alcohol withdrawal affects our brain and body. You may feel like alcohol is your coping mechanism: a way to deal with , , or other difficult feelings. You might be nervous about what life would be like if you stopped drinking or cut back. But relying on alcohol to manage your mental well-being can become a problem in itself. There s no shame in asking for help and exploring what a new relationship with alcohol could look like. Alcohol is a depressant, which can disrupt the balance of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in your brain and affect your feelings, thoughts and behaviour. Alcohol affects the part of your brain that controls inhibition, so you may feel relaxed, less anxious, and more confident after a drink. But these effects quickly wear off. The chemical changes in your brain can soon lead to more negative feelings, such as anger, depression or anxiety, regardless of your mood. Alcohol also slows down how your brain processes information, making it harder to work out what you’re really feeling and the possible consequences of your actions. In the long-term, alcohol uses up and reduces the number of neurotransmitters in our brains, but we need a certain level to ward off anxiety and depression. This can make you want to drink more to relieve these difficult feelings – which can start a cycle of dependence.
